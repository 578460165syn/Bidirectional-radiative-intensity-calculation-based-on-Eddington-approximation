# RT-model-for-a-vertical-inhomogeneous-medium
the code for the paper named "Bidirectional radiative intensity calculation based on Eddington approximation in a vertically inhomogeneous medium"

In the code

"n" is number of the level, "n=2" mean the code is suit for 1 lay (2 levels).

"u0" is cosine of solar zentih angel

"u" is cosine of zentih angel

"Del_varph" is difference between the azimuth angel and the the solar azimuth angel

"tt" is optical depth of the medium.

"ww" is single scattering albedo at "tt/2." in the medium

"g" is asymmetry factor at "tt/2" in the medium

"fuu1(n)" is upward flux at level "n" for homogeneous Eddington solution

"fdu1(n)" is downward flux at level "n" for homogeneous Eddington solution
